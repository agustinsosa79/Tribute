                    <p>1-Eliminate distractions: focus

                        In 1986, 10 years after Apple was founded, Jobs distanced himself from the company's board of directors and was fired from the company he had created. In 1997, he returned to the firm when it was in financial crisis. He immediately decided to abandon several of the organization's projects and focus on only four, which he considered to be priorities. “Let's do four things and do them spectacularly well,” he said.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        2-Simplify everything
                        
                        In line with the above, Jobs preached the optimization of resources, the abandonment of the superfluous and the appreciation of the essential. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        3-Take responsibility
                        
                        Jobs considered that leading was taking responsibility for the entire process of each creation. This maxim is related to the fact that Apple products, in general, have been and continue to be incompatible with other brands. That, he said, is the only way to take full responsibility for the process, flow, and user experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        4-If one falls behind, one must leap forward
                        
                        When Microsoft overtook the Mac by adding CD burners to its computers, Apple decided to take a leap that was revolutionary. He created iTunes, a multi-device storage system that changed the music industry.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        5-The first thing is to create a good product, then you will think about the profits
                        
                        "Focus on creating a great product, the benefits will follow." Jobs took it for granted that good things generate profits, therefore, that the impulse of every great idea must be the idea itself and not the eventual profits, this will come in addition.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        6-Do not rely too much on focus groups
                        
                        Jobs felt somewhat confined by the results of the tests through opinion groups to which each product was submitted. At that moment one of his most famous phrases emerged: "People don't know what they want until you show it to them." He believed that if they just stuck to market research they would repeat the devices they created because the human mind tends to always make associations with previous experiences. Therefore, it was necessary not to give such studies such importance because there was a risk of repeating themselves and only doing what people already know.

                        7-Distorting reality to demolish the impossible in life
                        
                        At one point, his partner Stephen Gary Wozniak (Woz, co-founder of Apple) had to advance a new project and he considered that it would take him 6 months. It was when another of Jobs's famous phrases arose. “Do you need 6 months to develop that? You can do it in 4 days!” And Woz did it. Mental models and self-imposed limits are usually the greatest impediments for leaders.
                        
                        There is no such thing as perfection in life, but I wanted Apple devices to come close enough

                        8-Transmit permanently
                        
                        One of its premises was that everything communicates and adds value. Apple devices generate an experience for the consumer since he wants to have one of them. He considered that importance should be given, even to the apparently most trivial, such as packaging. Apple products are a piece of design in themselves. For example, a detail that Jobs imposed were the fonts that include the products created by his brand. It was a pioneer in including thousands of font models, from the simplest to the most sophisticated and eye-catching, something that Windows initially lacked, which only had a few letter variants, until the Bill Gates brand should have imitated his competitor. The story of Jobs' love for typography was told by himself. When he abandoned his studies in systems at Reeds University he entered calligraphy classes. This knowledge, at that time, did not make any sense, since it did not seem to be a great contribution to his future. But he was fascinated by that aspect of graphic design and it later became clear how important it was to him.

                        9-Demand excellence
                        
                        Jobs required that all his brand products be fully tested by all possible checks and tests before being released. There is no such thing as perfection in life, but I wanted Apple devices to come close enough.

                        10-Hire the best
                        
                        It was a way of admitting that all his projects were possible thanks to the team that accompanied him. The key to his leadership was to surround himself with great professionals, perhaps better than the leader himself, with experience in the necessary fields and allow them to shine.
                        
                        On June 12, 2005, Jobs was invited to speak at a graduation ceremony at Stanford University, California. That exhibition quickly became famous and its recording has thousands of views on YouTube. Closing, he said one of his most prominent and repeated phrases, which speak of his concept of leadership: “Keep hungry, keep foolish. Go for more. Question. Discover. Creates".
                        
                        When he gave that brief lecture, he believed that he had been cured of pancreatic cancer that had been diagnosed over a year before.
                        
                        "I had a surgery and now i am fine. This is the closest I've come to death, and I hope it's the closest I'll get to it for a few more decades. Having lived through this, I can now tell you this with more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: Nobody wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the fate we all share. No one has escaped from it. And so it has to be, because death is possibly the best invention of life. It is the agent of change of life. Remove the old to make room for the new.</p>
